# Explaining the purpose of each topic
### Hotel's Overbooking Strategy
Overbooking is a common revenue strategy in which hotels use to maximize their short-term and long-term sales potential. However, the issue with this is that guests do not care about a hotel’s revenue and only want to get the room they had booked. This means that if a hotel’s overbooking strategy is bad and it does not handle customers who were affected by the overbookings effectively, it would lead to bad online reviews, damaging the hotel’s reputation. Thus, it is important to find out whether a hotel’s overbooking strategy is working well or should there be any sort of changes made to it.

### Hotel’s Distribution Channel 
A hotel generally has a variety of distribution channels that would help to sell its rooms to its customers. However, maintaining these distribution channels comes at a cost. Since the purpose of a hotel’s sales and marketing team is to maximize the hotel’s sales and profit, it would be unwise to keep a distribution channel that is producing poor sales. Thus, it is important to find out which distribution channel produces the most sales and which distribution channel is doing poorly and make decisions based on that information.

### Hotel’s Reservation Cancellations
Cancellations happen all the time, causing businesses to incur losses just because their customers have canceled their orders or bookings last minute. Therefore, to prevent or reduce the number of customers that are canceling their bookings, it is important for the hotel’s sales and marketing to understand and find out the reasons why customers cancel their bookings.

### Exploring Customer’s Needs and Wants
Understanding customer’s needs and wants is important because it allows the hotel to provide an experience that would surpass their expectations, greatly satisfying them and potentially increasing their chances of coming back to the hotel. Thus, it is important to find out what do customers require and expect from the hotel.
